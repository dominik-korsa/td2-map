# Train Driver 2 Interactive Map project
This Rust project aims to generate an SVG map based on a Train Driver 2 scenery file and ultimately add support for live train location display and route preview.

Since starting work on this project I've discovered https://github.com/izawartka/td2-visualizer. This repository is now archived, as I've decided to contribute to that project instead.
